### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Brazilian Product Designer with Software engineering skills and distinctive experience working for early-stage (seed, series A, and B) startups.

I'm currently the Founding Product Designer and first employee at Ground (Techstars and FFF). Previously, I was one of the first design hires at Nubank (NYSE: NU), and later joined Fast, backed by Stripe and Index Ventures.
