### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Brazilian Product Designer with Software engineering skills and distinctive experience working for early-stage (seed, series A, and B) startups.

I'm currently the Founding Product Designer and first employee at [Ground](https://joinground.com/) (Techstars and FFF). Previously, I was one of the first design hires at [Nubank (NYSE: NU)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nubank), and later joined Fast, backed by Stripe and Index Ventures.

At Nubank, I helped shape the future of financial services in LATAM. I worked across Credit Card, Customer Support, and Payments, combining design and engineering to build experiences that now serve over 100 million customers.

At Fast, I focused on scaling our Design System across teams and driving adoption among engineers and designers. I also designed the 1-Click Checkout experience and the Mobile SDK for merchants.
